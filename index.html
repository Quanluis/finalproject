      <h2>What is a Kappa?</h2>
      <p>
        A mythological creature that inhabits the Rivers and ponds of Japan. The
        Kappa possesses the humanoid and reptilian structure of a turtle causing
        mischief and preying on the unlucky few with trauma or death.
      </p>
      <h2>Characteristics</h2>
      <p>
        Kappas are usually depicted or drawn with green skin, funny-looking
        heads and a turtle shell for protection. It's said that the top of their
        heads is filled with water and most of their power is channeled within
        it. Some say the best way to defeat one is to hit it on the head.
      </p>
      <h2>Pop culture</h2>
      <p>
        In pop culture, the Kappa has influenced many creators such as those in
        video games, movies and art such as anime. A few examples of these
        creatures can be seen in Pokemon, Nintendos bowser character, the ninja
        turtles and animes such as Sarazanmai.
      </p>
      <h2>Kappa Diet</h2>
      <p>
        Kappas usually eat a wide range of foods those including Salamanders,
        insects, Humans and cucumbers. They're known for walking around with
        cucumbers in their hands for energy and to wack their victims with.
