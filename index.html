        <h2>What is a Kappa?</h2>
        <p>A mythological creature that inhabits the Rivers and ponds of Japan. 
            The Kappa posseses the humanoid and reptilian structure of a turtle causing 
            michief and preying on the unlucky few with trauma or death.

        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Kappas are usually depectited or drawn with green skin, funny looking heads, and a turtle 
            shell for protection. It's said that the top of their heads is filled with water and most 
            of their power is channeled within it. Some say the best way to defeat one is to hit it on the 
            head.
