            <h3>Keeping children away.</h3>
            <p>Many people believe that the Kappa was used to scare children from entering the Japanese ponds. Parents would teach their children that the kappa would drown them if they got too close to the ponds and rivers. In reality, Japanese parents would abandon their undesirable children in these waters, giving historians a reason to believe they didn't want their children to discover the aftermath.</p>
        <h3>Portuguese monks</h3>
        <p>The monks came to japan in 1549, their bald heads and pale skin caused many to see a similar resemblance to this created monster, seeing a sort of cultural resistance to outside foreigners.</p>
        <h3>japenese Giant Salamander</h3>
        <p>Some historians claim that the Kappa originated from the fear of Japenese Giant Salamander. They're known to grab their prey with their powerful jaws and submerge them into the waters. They're also known to inhabit the same areas of the Kappa such as rivers and ponds.</p>
