            <h3>Keeping children away.</h3>
        <p class="history">Many people believe that the Kappa was used to scare children
            from entering the japenese ponds. Parents would teach their children 
            that the kappa would drown them if they got too close to the ponds and rivers.
            In reality japenese parents would abondon their undesirable children in these waters, 
            giving historians a reason to believe they didnt want their children discovering the 
            aftermath.

        <h3>Portuguese monks</h3>
        <p class="history">The monks came to japan in 1549, their bald heads and pale skin caused many to see a 
            similar resemblance to this created monster, seeing a sort of cultural resistnce to 
            outside foreiners. 
        </p>
        <h3>japenese Giant Salamander</h3>
        <p class="History">Some historians claim that the Kappa originated from the 
            fear of Japenese Giant Salamander.They're known to grab their prey with their 
            powerful jaws and submerge them into the waters. They're also known to inhabit the 
            same areas of the Kappa such as rivers and ponds.
